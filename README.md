## CRITIC_cross-efficiency_DEA Application to the three-level hierarchical DEA model in Kao (2015)
Kao (2015) [^1] evaluated the physic department of twenty universities by the hierarchical data envelopment analysis(DEA) model. Based on the network DEA, the department system is 
decomposed into four subordiantes 
1. $E^{U}$ (teaching of undergarduates)
2. $E^{G}$ (teaching of graduates)
3. $E^{R}$ (research)  
4. $E^{S}$ (services)

Below is a diagram depicting a hierarchical network structure with **2** inputs and 
**7** outputs.

Taking the resource-allocation problem between the undergraduate and graduate sections,
Kao (2015) defined the following shared-inputs hierarhical network DEA model after 
decomposititon.

Note that $\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2},\alpha_{3}$ represent the allocating proportion of inputs 
to teaching (Unit 1), research (Unit2) and service (Unit3), while $\beta_{1}, \beta_{2}$ 
indicate the allocation proportion for undergraduate (Unit 1-1)and graduate divisions 
(Unit 1-2). 

In above model, the first five constraints control the efficiency range of the overall 
inputs and four units - _the efficiency of each unit should be no greater than 1_. And the fifth constraint defines the range of  allocation indexes $\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2},\alpha_{3}$ , $\beta_{1}, \beta_{2}$.Then, let's see the model result by Kao (2015).

The second column in the table above is the network DEA result by CCR model, in which over
half of DMUs are evaluated as efficient. Compared with CCR model result, the result in
the third column shows better discrimintory power.

However, there are three issues exist:
1. lacking of peer-evaluated result, making the result less acceptable by DMUs.
2. Not all DMUs receive a unique ranking in $E^{U}$, $E^{G}$. $E^{R}$, $E^{S}$.
3. Many zeroes in multipliers generated by this model. 

## Proposed CRITIC cross-efficiency approach
Here compares Kao's model with two models:
1. Liu et al. (2022)'s [^2] combination of **maxmin secondary objective model** and **neutral cross-efficiency model**.
2. A combination of **maxmin secondary objective model** and **CRITIC cross-efficiency model**.

#### Maxmin DEA model
Both methods utlize the maxmin secondary objective DEA model before applying the cross-efficiency approach.
The coding has been prepared which can be run on Lingo software. It demadns **20 times** running of [self-evaluated 
three-level hierarchical DEA model](./SelfEvaHierarchialDEA.lng) proposed by Kao (2015).\
_Note: We can get each DMU's self-evaluated efficiency of each component by adjusting the k value on the 30th line._

After recording the $E^{U}$, $E^{G}$. $E^{R}$, $E^{S}$, $E^{NW}$ results for each DMU, making them as inputs, along 
with k in [maxmin secondary objective model](./Maxmin_DEA_model.lng) to get the maxmin DEA results with another 
**20 times** running of the program.

After these two steps, we can get five efficiency matrixs, in which $E_{kj}$ indicates the jth observation under
kth criteria, see [cross-efficiency table - sheet1- summary](./CE_DEA.xlsx)

#### Liu et al's Neutral CE approach.
