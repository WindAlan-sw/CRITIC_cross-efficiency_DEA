# CRITIC_cross-efficiency_DEA
Kao (2015) [^1] evaluated the physic department of twenty universities by the hierarchical data envelopment analysis(DEA) model. Based on the network DEA, the department system is 
decomposed into four subordiantes 
1. $E^{U}$ (teaching of undergarduates)
2. $E^{G}$ (teaching of graduates)
3. $E^{R}$ (research)  
4. $E^{S}$ (services)

Below is a diagram depicting a hierarchical network structure with **2** inputs and 
**7** outputs.

Taking the resource-allocation problem between the undergraduate and graduate sections,
Kao (2015) defined the following shared-inputs hierarhical network DEA model after 
decomposititon.
